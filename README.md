## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GIVEN a functional Express.js API, WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. WHEN I enter schema and seed commands, THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
3. WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
5. WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
